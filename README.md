Introduction:
This project is aimed at creating Hazel using Python programming language. The virtual assistant is designed to perform basic tasks such as answering questions, scheduling appointments, setting reminders, and providing basic information.

Requirements:

Python 3.6 or later version
A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
The following Python modules:

Installation:

Install Python 3.6 or later version from the official website.
Open the command prompt or terminal and install the required Python modules using the following commands:
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pyaudio
pip install wikipedia
pip install datetime
pip install os and many more

Process:
Initial we started with process of creating the virtualenv and naming it env.
All the required libs as per the requiremnt were installed during the process.
As we moved forwrd the libraries were increased as well as the complexity of the program kept on increasing.
Sometimes we faced different problem will installing the libraries but we succcessfully tackled that problem and got the work done.
Implementing this inside the program was also an important and difficult task.
However completed our total project with in the time.

Things can be Done using Hazel:A virtual Assistant:
        This is just a example of "How you can give commands"
        like for example there is a commnad "play music" so you can say that would you "play some music for m
        e" or the alternative of it like "I would like to listen some musics".
        But not all alternative will work.
        1) Saying Hii,I am Fine,who developed you
        2)Take a note / Make a note
        3)Capture my screen / Take a screen shot
        4)Open youtube,
        5) Open Google,
        6) Open command prompt,
        7) Open chrome,
        8) Open Instagram,
        9) Open Facebook,
        10) play (song name) on youtube
        11) What is my exact/current location
        12) take a photo/ take a selfie
        13) play music
        14) Open Calculator
        15) open news
        16) open file manager
        17) open vs code
        18) What is the time
        19) tell me some jokes
        20) search wikipedia for Shahrukh Khan (topic you want to search for)
        21) send an email
        22) Change brigthness
        23) exit/ quit/ shutdown/ goodbye Hazel



Conclusion:
Creating Hazel using Python can be a fun and challenging project. With the right tools and modules, you can build a functional virtual assistant that can help you with basic tasks and provide useful information.

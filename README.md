**Introduction:**

This project is aimed at creating Hazel using the Python programming language. Hazel is a virtual assistant designed to perform basic tasks such as answering questions, scheduling appointments, setting reminders, and providing basic information.

**Requirements:**

    Python 3.6 or later version
    A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    
    The following Python modules:
        speech_recognition
        pyttsx3
        pyaudio
        wikipedia
        datetime
        os
        beautifulsoup4==4.11.2
        certifi==2022.12.7
        cffi==1.15.1
        charset-normalizer==3.1.0
        click==8.1.3
        colorama==0.4.6
        comtypes==1.1.14
        Flask==2.2.3
        idna==3.4
        itsdangerous==2.1.2
        Jinja2==3.1.2
        MarkupSafe==2.1.2
        MouseInfo==0.1.3
        numpy==1.24.2
        opencv-python==4.7.0.72
        Pillow==9.4.0
        playsound==1.3.0
        soupsieve==2.4
        SpeechRecognition==3.10.0
        ttkthemes==3.2.2
        urllib3==1.26.15
        Werkzeug==2.2.3
        wikipedia==1.4.0
        WMI==1.5.1

**Process:**

    1) Initially, we started with the process of creating the virtual environment and naming it env.
    2) All the required libraries as per the requirement were installed during the process.
    3) As we moved forward, the libraries were increased, and the complexity of the program kept on increasing.
    4) Sometimes we faced different problems while installing the libraries, but we successfully tackled those problems and got the work done.
    5) Implementing this inside the program was also an important and difficult task.
    6) However, we completed our total project within the time.

**Things can be Done using Hazel: A Virtual Assistant:**

This is just an example of "How you can give commands" like for example there is a command "play music" so you can say that would you "play some music for me" or the alternative of it like "I would like to listen to some music". But not all alternatives will work.
Here are some commands that Hazel can perform:

    1) Saying "Hi," "I am fine," "who developed you?"
    2) Take a note / Make a note
    3) Capture my screen / Take a screenshot
    4) Open YouTube
    5) Open Google
    6) Open command prompt
    7) Open Chrome
    8) Open Instagram
    9) Open Facebook
    10) Play (song name) on YouTube
    11) What is my exact/current location?
    12) Take a photo/ take a selfie
    13) Play music
    14) Open Calculator
    15) Open news
    16) Open file manager
    17) Open VS code
    18) What is the time?
    19) Tell me some jokes
    20) Search Wikipedia for Shahrukh Khan (topic you want to search for)
    21) Send an email
    22) Change brightness
    23) Exit/ quit/ shutdown/ goodbye Hazel

**Conclusion:**

Creating Hazel using Python can be a fun and challenging project. With the right tools and modules, you can build a functional virtual assistant that can
